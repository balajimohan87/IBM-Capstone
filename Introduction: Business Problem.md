Road accidents occur when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, tree, or any stationary object like a building. Road accidents cause property damage or sometimes injury leading to either disability or even extreme case a threat to life.

Road accidents may occur due to various factors like visibility, traffic congestion on certain days, or weather. There are several statistics available in both open and closed domains for people to analyze and also create models to avoid road accidents in the future.

Once the models are created, it can either help reduce road accidents by warning the human beings or feeding these models into Autonomous vehicle systems to make clever decisions to avoid accidents.

The model can serve society in a very beneficial way of reducing property loss as well as the loss of life.

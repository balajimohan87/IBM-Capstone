# Data

The dataset used in this study consists of 37 attributes and one target. The road accidents may be of any kind like a car collision, bicycle, other vehicle collisions. The data is collected from 2004 to present and provided by SPD and recorded by traffic records. The dataset is updated weekly based on the data collected every week.

The dataset was imbalanced with a lot of unknowns and null values. The dataset was cleaned by assigning the modal value of each attribute to the unknowns and null values. Then the attributes were encoded using a label encoder to assign integer values.
